# scripts-to-rule-them-all-go
Inspired from the 2015 repo for "Scripts to Rule Them All", this applies that same concept but with using a more modern toolchain like Go and Mage. Mage provides a Go based task runner that can replace makefiles, custom bash/python/powershell scripts, and instead provide a cross-platform common set of commands to run a project.
